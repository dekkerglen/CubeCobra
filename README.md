# CubeCobra
CubeCobra is an open source web application for building, managing, and playtesting Magic the Gathering cubes.
### Project Goals
Cube Cobra strives to be a cube management tool that doesn't need to be supplemented with any other tool such as excel, gatherer, or another cube management app. Cube Cobra should be a platform that is easy to use, that still has advanced features that provide users with a high degree of freedom to organize and analyze their cube in a way that makes sense to them. Cube Cobra aims to create the best possible platform for users to build, playtest, and share their cube.
