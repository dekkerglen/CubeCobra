# Setup

### Install Prerequisites

You will need to install NodeJS, MongoDB, and an IDE of your preference (I reccomend Atom). You can find the neccesary resources here:

NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

MongoDB: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

You will need start a MongoDB background process, and create a database titled 'nodecube'. Refer to the official documentation for directions on how to set this up for your OS. Running 'use nodecube' in the mongo CLI is sufficient.

Atom (optional): https://atom.io/

### Clone Project

Clone the project into a folder of your choice. Then, you will need to add a folder adjacent to the project folder like this:

    .
    ├── CubeCobra               # Cloned repository
    └── cubecobrasecrets        # Secrets folder
        └── email.js            # Secrets file


In email.js, you can paste the following, and replace the fields with any gmail account you have access to. You only need to fill out these fields with real information if you need to create user account validation emails.

    module.exports =
    {
      username:'YOUR_EMAIL',
      password:'YOUR_PASSWORD'
    }

Then, run the following commands in the root of the cloned repository:

    npm install
    npm install nodemon -g
    node force_update.js
    nodemon

You can now open up a browser and connect to the app through: http://localhost:5000

Nodemon will restart the application anytime there is a change to a source file.

### Running tests

To run the test suite, run `npm run test`
