# Setup

### Install Prerequisites

You will need to install NodeJS, MongoDB, and an IDE of your preference (I reccomend Atom). You can find the neccesary resources here:

NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

MongoDB: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

You will need start a MongoDB background process, and create a database titled 'nodecube'. Refer to the official documentation for directions on how to set this up for your OS. Running 'use nodecube' in the mongo CLI is sufficient.

Atom (optional): https://atom.io/

### Clone Project

Clone the project into a folder of your choice. Create a symbolic link from
`../cubecobrasecrets` to `cubecobrasecrets.example`:

  cd CubeCobra/..
  ln -s CubeCobra/cubecobrasecrets.example cubecobrasecrets

The resulting directory structure should look like this:

    .
    ├── CubeCobra               # Cloned repository
    └── cubecobrasecrets        # link to `CubeCobra/cubecobrasecrets.example`
        └── email.js            # Email secrets file
        └── etc...

Then, run the following commands in the root of the cloned repository:

    npm install
    npm install nodemon -g
    node force_update.js
    npm start

You can now open up a browser and connect to the app through: http://localhost:8080

Nodemon will restart the application anytime there is a change to a source file.

### Running tests

To run the test suite, run `npm run test`
