    dt.col-3 Why does Cube Cobra provide that other tools do not?
    dd.col-9
      p The biggest advantage Cube Cobra has right now is a more modern and maintainable technology stack compared to other tools. This means Cube Cobra is updated frequently and is committed to
        |  adding features that the community asks for. There are some features that are are big improvements over other tools,
        |  such as an easier way to manage card versions, a sortable cube view, and since the website is powered by scryfall, newly spoiled cards can be used at most 24 hrs
        |  after being spoiled, with no downtime! 
    dt.col-3 What tech stack does Cube Cobra use?
    dd.col-9
      p Cube Cobra is built using NodeJS with MongoDB for the internal database, and JADE/PUG for the templating engine. Cube Cobra uses a lot of client side javascript, 
        |  bootstrap for CSS, and relies heavily on Scryfall API.        
    dt.col-3 Is Cube Cobra Open Source?
    dd.col-9
      p Currently, No. There are no concrete plans to open source Cube Cobra, but is something we are looking into, as the goal is to create the best possible tool for the community and
        | it's likely that open sourcing is the best route with that goal in mind.
