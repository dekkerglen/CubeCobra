# Contributing to express-validator
Hey! We are glad you want to help us improve express-validator.

Even though we will appreciate any contribution, please make sure to read [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) on how to contribute on GitHub.  
It's a short read and will get you started on how most things work.

## Issues
In case you are having issues while using express-validator, make sure to browse through the project's issues before opening a new one.  
Someone else may have had the same problem before.

When opening a new issue, please provide us some code that reproduces the errors you're getting, perhaps some logs too, express-validator version, etc.  
Every detail you can give will be of great help.

## Pull Requests
Do you want to dedicate your time to help improve the codebase? Great! Then submitting a pull request is the best way to do this.

In case you opened a issue, then fixing it yourself is the fastest way to get it done.  
Otherwise, feel free to browse through the open issues and find some ideas on what needs some implementation.

We have some requirements regarding pull requests:
- **Every pull request must include tests!**
- **The builds must pass**; if they don't, click through, find out why, and fix it.
- If you're adding/changing functionality, make sure to reflect the changes in the readme file.

Finally, remember: **this is an open source project. We contribute whenever our time allows us.**
